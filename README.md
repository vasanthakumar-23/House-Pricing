## Overview

In this project, we utilized a dataset containing various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, location, and other relevant factors affecting house prices. By employing machine learning algorithms, including (insert algorithms used), we developed a model that can predict house prices based on these features. The aim is to provide valuable insights for potential home buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.

## Data

The dataset used for this project was obtained from (mention the data source) and contains (number) of instances with (number) of features. The data was preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features. For more information on the dataset and its features, please refer to the (data preprocessing) script.

## Methodology

The project utilized (insert programming language) for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. We employed various machine learning algorithms, including (list the algorithms used) to build and train the house price prediction model. The model was evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared value to assess its performance and accuracy.

## Results

The results of the house price prediction model demonstrate its effectiveness in accurately estimating house prices based on the provided features. The model achieved a (mention the performance metrics) and exhibited strong predictive capabilities. Further details on the model's performance can be found in the (evaluation) script.

## Usage

To use the house price prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies as specified in the requirements.txt file.
3. Run the (main script file) to load the model and make predictions on new data.
